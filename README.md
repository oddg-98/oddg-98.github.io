# Personal Website Project

This is the repository for my personal website project, where I showcase various aspects of my interests and activities. The website includes sections dedicated to books I've read, websites I visit frequently, hobbies, and interests.

- **Books I've Read:** This section contains a curated list of books I've read, along with brief descriptions and personal reflections.
- **Frequently Visited Websites:** Here, I share links to websites that I visit frequently for various purposes such as learning, news, or entertainment.
- **Hobbies and Interests:** This section provides information about my hobbies and interests, including any ongoing projects or activities I am passionate about.
